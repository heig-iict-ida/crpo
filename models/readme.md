In an earlier version, users had to download and unpack here the ZIP files from Switch Drive containing the models.

Now the models are downloaded automatically, upon the first use, from Huggingface.  This folder can be deleted.

There are nine models (which were previously stored in subfolders of this folder, but are now stored in the cache of the Transformers library):
  - gpt2-poetry-model-crpo (general decoder model for initial generation)
  - anger (one of the 3 emotion models, encoder)
  - happiness (one of the 3 emotions)
  - sadness (one of the 3 emotions)
  - art (one of the 5 topics, encoder)
  - life (one of the 5 topics, actually *life and death*)
  - love (one of the 5 topics)
  - nature (one of the 5 topics)
  - religion (one of the 5 topics)
